The core package containing the main functionality of Felte. This allows to make Felte compatible with multiple frameworks or vanilla javascript. More documenttion on this pending.

Since this package is _bundled_ with other packages, breaking changes might occur in between minor versions, specially if they're required to _prevent_ breaking changes on the other packages.

If you're looking to use Felte for any of your apps, you're most likely looking for:

- [felte](/packages/felte) if you're working with Svelte.

- [@felte/solid](/packages/solid) if you're working with Solid.

- [@felte/react](/packages/react) if your're working with React.

- [@felte/element](/packages/element) if you're working with vanilla JS.
