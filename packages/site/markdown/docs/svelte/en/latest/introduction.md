## Felte

Felte is a simple and extensible form library for Svelte. Its purpose is to let you handle form reactivity as easily as possible without having to use any components such as `Form` or `Field` to let you style your fields easily. Its extensibility also allows to build solutions for common issues such as [error reporting](/docs/reporters) or [validation](/docs/validators).

Thanks a lot for considering Felte for your project! We hope it's an enjoyable experience! To get started you can go to the [getting started](/docs/getting-started) section or check on the side menu the topic you're interested in.
